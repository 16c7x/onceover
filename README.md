# Controlreo Gem

## Configuration

```ruby
repo = Controlrepo.new()
repo.role_regex = /.*/ # Tells the class how to find roles, will be applied to repo.classes
repo.profile_regex = /.*/ # Tells the class how to find profiles, will be applied to repo.classes
```

# Running the tests

This gem allows us to easily and dynamically test all of the roles and profiles in our environment against fact sets from all of the nodes to which they will be applied. All we need to do is create a spec test that calls out to the `Controlrepo` ruby class:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
require 'controlrepo'

controlrepo = Controlrepo.new()

controlrepo.roles.each do |role|
  describe role do
    controlrepo.facts.each do |facts|
      context "on #{facts['fqdn']}" do
        let(:facts) { facts }
        it { should compile }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This will iterate over each role in the controlrepo and test that it compiles with each set of facts.

The same can also be done with profiles just by using the profiles method instead:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
require 'controlrepo'

controlrepo = Controlrepo.new()

controlrepo.profiles.each do |profile|
  describe profile do
    controlrepo.facts.each do |facts|
      context "on #{facts['fqdn']}" do
        let(:facts) { facts }
        it { should compile }
      end
    end
  end
end
```
